        <h2>Ruby/Rails</h2>
          <p>I come from a family that likes to cook, so I created the <a href="https://github.com/astridw/Family_Recipes" target ="_blank">
          Family Recipe App</a> to help us keep track of recipes. It also has a calendar feature that lets you schedule when you plan
          to cook a recipe as well. This is especially helpful since we have big dinners together. I have plans to make this into a potluck app as well. </p>
          <p>I made the <a href="https://github.com/astridw/pinteresting" target="_blank"> Pinterest Clone</a> to help me learn more about modals.</p>
          <p> I also have a terminal game callled <a href="https://github.com/astridw/Blackjack" target ="_blank"> Ruby Blackjack</a> that taught me better command of Ruby and was
            <a href="http://ianthro.com/ruby-blackjack-part-3" target ="_blank">a pain</a> to make at the time. But I love it cause by the time I completed it I felt so proud of this little game.</p>

        <h2> Landing Pages </h2>
          <p>One of my first freelance projects involved me making the landing page for a growing company <a href="http://obellabe.com" target="_blank"> Obella Be.</a>
          This felt like a great way to mix my love of medicine, community, and code.</p>

      <h2> Anthropology</h2>
      <p>I was invited to speak at the <a href="https://eventscribe.net/2016/aaa/index.asp" target="_blank">annual meeting</a> of the American Anthropology Association
        on <a href="http://www.eventscribe.net/2016/AAA/QRcode.asp?Pres=213011" target="_blank">a panel</a> about anthropology and communciation, which was based on my work as a practicing
        anthropologist in tech. The trip made me love <a href="http://ianthro.com/aaa-conference-2016" target="_blank">anthropology and software</a> even more. </p>
