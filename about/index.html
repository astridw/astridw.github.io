      <h3> My Background</h3>
        <p>I started academic life at Baylor University where I studied Psychology, Neuroscience, and Linguistics
          with plans to become a neurosurgeon. But, I fell in love with social science, changed plans, and went on
           to the University of Houston where I received a Masters in Anthropology. I did thesis work studying diabetes
           and had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Chronic-Disease-Willis-Countee/dp/3659809977/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1450937203&sr=8-1&keywords=astrid+countee">
              my book</a> published in 2015.</p>

        <p>While in graduate school I started to code in my job as a data analyst, and grew to love
          programming and computer science. After progressing into more senior data analyst positions,
          I left to learn how to become a software engineer at <a href="https://theironyard.com"
          target="_blank">The Iron Yard Academy.</a>
          <p> Since then, I have worked at large companies, startups and not-for-profit orgs. For me, its about mixing and matching computer and social science and working on projects that serve
            and amplify people and causes.  I am currently attending University of Houston-Victoria for Masters in
            Computer Science and Math. I am also a panelist for the podcast <a href="http://www.greaterthancode.com/" target="_blank"> >code.</a>

        <h3> What I am doing now </h3>
        <h5> inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/now" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> version of a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target ="_blank">now</a> page.</h5>

          <p> I am focusing on building a drupal site for <a href="http://techforjustice.org" target="_blank">Tech For Justice</a>. This will be the foundation of our JusticeHub project,
            meant to bring together people who are interested on working on tech projects that give more access to justice. I am new to drupal, so it is learn as I go for me.

          </p> Christmas will be at my house this year, and since I have been busy completing finals and working on building a drupal site, I have a lot of cleaning up to do.
          I am about to start work on an article about the superhero series, <a href="http://marvel.com/universe/Cage,_Luke" target="_blank">Luke Cage</a>, which means binge watching for me next week in between the cleaning and the Christmas.
