      <h3> My Background</h3>
        <p>I started academic life at Baylor University where I studied Psychology, Neuroscience, and Linguistics
          with plans to become a neurosurgeon. But, I fell in love with social science, changed plans, and went on
           to the University of Houston where I received a Masters in Anthropology. I did thesis work studying diabetes
           and had <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Family-Chronic-Disease-Willis-Countee/dp/3659809977/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1450937203&sr=8-1&keywords=astrid+countee">
              my book</a> published in 2015.</p>

        <p>While in graduate school I started to code in my job as a data analyst, and grew to love
          programming and computer science. After progressing into more senior data analyst positions,
          I left to learn how to become a software engineer at <a href="https://theironyard.com"
          target="_blank">The Iron Yard Academy.</a>
          <p> Since then, I have worked at large companies, startups and not-for-profit orgs. For me, its about mixing and matching computer and social science and working on projects that serve
            and amplify people and causes.  I am currently attending University of Houston-Victoria for Masters in
            Computer Science and Math. I am also a panelist for the podcast <a href="http://www.greaterthancode.com/" target="_blank"> >code.</a>

        <h3> What I am doing now </h3>
        <h5> inspired by <a href="https://sivers.org/now" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a> version of a <a href="http://nownownow.com/about" target ="_blank">now</a> page.</h5>

          <p> I am managaing the creation of JusticeHub, one of the first big tech projects for  <a href="http://techforjustice.org" target="_blank">Tech For Justice</a>. Working on this project has taken from from
            developer to product manager and I am learning a lot.
          </p>
          <p> I have also started taking a few online courses in order to get me back in the beginners mindset as I write curriculum for students at The Iron Yard.</p>
          <p> I have also started some exciting freelance writing projects that I am looking forward to being out soon.</p>
          <ul>Books I'm Reading
          <p>
            <li>Ruth Benedict's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Culture-Ruth-Benedict-ebook/dp/B00CKDFEEW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494033942&sr=8-1&keywords=patterns+of+culture" target="_blank">Patterns of Culture</a></li> an old school anthropology classic.

            <li>Cal Newport's<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1494034025&sr=8-1&keywords=so+good+they+can%27t+ignore+you"
            target ="_blank"> So Good They Can't Ignore You.</a></li>
         </p>
          </ul>
        </p> Things have been busy for me as I have taken on new projects and a new position at The Iron Yard. But as always, I remain excited about what I am working on.
